Welcome to my Github

My name is Luis and I am currently enrolled in the Amazon Re/Start program in Berlin to obtain the "AWS Cloud Practitioner" certificate.

I am relatively new to cloud computing although I have basic/intermediate IT skills:
I do know a bit of Ruby and Python as well as of SQL, HTML, Bash, and networking.

These repositories are mostly to test out new skills as I learn them, but should be documented to illustrate its purpose and scope.

I’m interested in developing my AWS skills as a part of a career shift towards cloud computing. 

As mentioned, I’m currently learning the foundations of AWS and some other associated technologies, such as Git and Docker.

In this context I’m looking to collaborate on small and accessible projects that can put my knowledge to the test.

Feel free to connect or contact me via LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/luis-correia-986b488

All the best!

Luis
